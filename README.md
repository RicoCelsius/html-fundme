# Ethers.js Web3 Provider

This is an example of how to use Ethers.js and the Web3 Provider to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. It has all the necessary code to connect to a wallet, fund a smart contract, withdraw funds, and view the balance of a smart contract.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   Ethers.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Run the application

```
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will need to connect to a wallet. To do this, click the "Connect" button. You should then see a confirmation that you are connected.

To fund the smart contract, enter the amount of Ether you would like to send and click the "Fund" button. This will send the Ether to the specified contract address.

To withdraw funds, click the "Withdraw" button. This will send the funds from the contract address back to the wallet address.

To view the balance of the contract address, click the "Balance" button. This will display the current balance of the contract address.
